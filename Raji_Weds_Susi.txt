He loved his bike
which made her enjo bike rides little more;
He loved food,
which made her take cooking classes more fondly;
He loved her unconditionally,
She understood the definition of LOVE ni his eyes !
Here we are announcing, we love each other and want you to 
rejoic with us in our celebration of love, friendship and commitment.
Yours,
Suseendran & Rajeshwari
